# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to take a look inside the company Pewlett Hackard, and determine how many employees were becoming eligible for retirement, and what positions they held within the company. This data would then be used to determine what action was necessary to address the upcoming labor shortfall.

## Results

Like many large companies, Pewlett Hackard is soon to face a large vacancy in staff due to the Baby Boomer generation reaching retirement age. Over 90,000 employees fit into the category of being retirement eligible, or are near retirement eligibility.

Pewlett Hackard developed a mentorship program, where retiring employees consult and aid current employees within the company, to help deal with this looming shortfall of senior level staff. From the analysis, it was determined that 1,550 staff fall into the current qualifications for the mentorship program.

## Summary

In order for Pewlett Hackard to effectively close vacancies caused by retiring employees, the mentorship eligibility qualifications should be broadened, so that there can be more hands on deck to assist in the transition of the younger work force into more senior level positions.
